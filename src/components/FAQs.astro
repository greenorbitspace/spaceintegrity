          <!-- FAQ 1 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the Space Integrity Initiative?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>The Initiative is a global framework designed to strengthen trust, transparency, and responsible practice across the space sector. It brings organisations together to adopt shared standards, integrity indicators, and a common language for communicating performance, mission impact, and sustainability commitments.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 2 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why does the space industry need an integrity framework now?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>As commercial activity accelerates, expectations around ethics, safety, data governance, and environmental impact are rising. Without a consistent framework, organisations struggle to benchmark themselves or demonstrate credibility. The Initiative provides clarity, comparability, and a trusted standard the entire sector can align behind.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 3 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Who can join the Initiative?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>Any organisation operating in, or adjacent to, the space sector is eligible—startups, scale-ups, national agencies, research institutions, service providers, and non-profits. The framework is scalable so both early-stage companies and established actors can meaningfully participate.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does membership include?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>Members gain access to the Integrity Charter, assessment tools, technical guidance, sector benchmarks, and the right to use the Space Integrity Mark. They can also participate in member roundtables, working groups, and joint communications programmes.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 5 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the Space Integrity Charter?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>The Charter outlines the core principles that members commit to: responsible operations, transparent reporting, safety-by-design, fair and inclusive practices, environmental stewardship, and ethical innovation. It serves as the foundation for the full Space Integrity Framework.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 6 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does the Initiative support compliance and improvement?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>Members receive a structured roadmap, practical guides, and templates to track improvements over time. The Initiative is not punitive; it is designed as a supportive mechanism that helps organisations mature their governance, sustainability, and operational integrity.</p>

          <!-- FAQ 7 -->
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is the assessment process public?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>No. Organisations choose what to disclose and when. The Initiative protects commercially sensitive information and encourages organisations to share their progress when they feel ready. Public declarations are optional but recommended to strengthen trust with stakeholders.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does the Space Integrity Mark signify?</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>The Mark signals that an organisation adheres to the Charter principles and actively works to improve its integrity performance. It is not a certification but a commitment-based trust marker, designed to be recognised across investors, customers, regulators, and partners.</p>
